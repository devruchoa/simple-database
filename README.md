# Simple Database
---
As a web programmer I work with relational databases every day, but how do they actually work?

Some questions remain open, such as:

1. Why can there only be one primary key per table?
2. How does rolling back a transaction work?
3. How a search is actually done
4. Why certain good practices are adopted
